# The Arcidaemonic Cipher

## Chapter One - The Death of Agrippa
### Part 1

Kamo Noritoshi, Gillial Ragno and Johann Metzger each started their day in the city of Highclere. Johann spoke with his business associate Svet "Ten Toes" Yaropolk to try and find more information about Agrippa's absence from the Chapel district.

The party met each other on the way to the pub, but Agrippa was not there. They waited for a moment and checked for clues, finding Agrippa's family seal carved into a table. They spoke with the barkeep who said Agrippa had come here 3 days ago, but hadn't been seen since. Leaving the pub they noticed a figure watching them from a rooftop as they passed through the Assasin's gate towards the Chapel district.

From there, the party asked around the neighborhood and narrowed down Agrippa's most likely location. He had a flat in an abandoned hostel, near the Yellow Door flophouse. The hostel had once been dedicated to the Golden Dragon, Ylajali.

Throwing subtly to the side, the party kicked down two doors and investigated Agrippa's workshop. They found Agrippa dead, stripped of all his valuables. In a large wardrobe they found a zombie, which attacked them. After defeating the zombie they found 3 sending stones, an unknown magical lamp, and 3 potions of healing.

Leaving the flat before anyone came to investigate the commotion the group went back to a friendly pub to plan their next move.
