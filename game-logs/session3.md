# The Arcidaemonic Cipher

## Chapter One - The Death of Agrippa
### Part 3

The party began still at Agrippa's apartment when newcomer, Nymarawyn Lazaar stumbled upon them. Nym was searching for Agrippa as well, but was slightly behind the party's progress in finding him. A cleric and historian from Bessarabia, Nym identifies ancient artifacts for Agrippa and doesn't ask too many questions as to where they came from.

The adventurers went to the church of Pyrrha in the Chapel District and spoke with Mother Eleftheria Elharar trying to find the location of the Arcidaemonic Cipher. Attempting to pose as prospective members of the church, Johann resisted the blessing of Pyrrha, making Eleftheria suspicous. Begging a free meal, the party sleuthed around the church finding an ancient looking crypt.

Johann was able to pick the lock, and Gilli stole a magic sheath from the grave site while finding a hidden entrance into the sewers. From there the party made their way through the dank tunnels, Gilli succumbing to the squalid conditions momentarily.

In a large drainage cistern, the adventureres were ambushed by rats of unusual size. After dispatching the rats and taking a short rest to heal, they began to ready themselves to continue on through the tunnels.
