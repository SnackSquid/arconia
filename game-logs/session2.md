# The Arcidaemonic Cipher

## Chapter One - The Death of Agrippa
### Part 2

The party began their evening together in a pub, determining how to unravel the myster of Agrippa's death. They decided to head to the Monastary to have their items identified by Julia, one of the girls there. Julia is a minor sage, blind but gifted with far sight. She was able to help the party identify the lantern of truesight. She was able to read the ruined pamphet which lead them to engine co 13 as the creator of the zombies.

Johann knew that 'Fighting' Jack Broughton was a member of engine co 13, and the party was able to infiltrate their headquarters meeting him at their bar. Johann convinced Jack to give up the location of the zombie creation warehouse in exchange for chartering him a fight in the future.

At the warehouse the party met William Vivour, a disgraced necromancer was putting together freshly exhumed corpses. Through a mix of deception (barely) and stealth, the party found a ledger with another one of Agrippa's addresses.

At Agrippa's flat, they confronted The Seeker, an unknown agent looking for Agrippa and convinced him of Agrippa's death. After a moment of searching Agrippa was found in a small hidden vent soiled and happy to see the party.

Agrippa was very pleased to see the trio and gave them a map and explained the treasure that they were seeking. The Arcidaemonic Cipher, a cipher that can decode the Ancient Draconic language and find the dragon artifacts sealed away by the 7 martyrs.

Supposedly, the cipher is located under the Church of Saint Caillech; one of the very few churches left in the Chapel district. It is dedicated to Pyrrha, the White Dragon.
