# Arcidaemonia

## Creation of the world

It is said the world was created by the union of the mother goddess Skald, creator of all life and the Titan Arcidaemon. They bore 6 daughters, the eternal dragons.

- Atargatis - (black dragonflight): life*, night, rest, death, knowledge
- Pyrrha - (white dragonflight): life, tempest, light, nobility, betrayal*
- Zoroastra - (blue dragonflight): water, trickery, knowledge, civilization
- Atossa - (red dragonflight): fire, strength, conquest, madness
- Rhessala - (green dragonflight): nature, luck, change, secrets
- Ylajali - (gold dragonflight): lightning, war, justice, technology

Arcidaemon became jealous and fearful of the dragons and ate them as they were sleeping. In a fury Skald struck down Arcidaemon and freed the dragons. She then instructed them to create the world out of the titan's corpse so that she never had to gaze upon his likeness again.

Each of the dragons ruled over a part of the kingdom of Arcidaemonia which covered all the known world, whose king was pledged to serve them. 

Pyrrha became covetous of her sister Atargatis' power over life. She met her one day and tried to convince her to reliquish the power. When she refused, Pyrrha slew her and took it for herself. From that day forward Atargatis was known as the first in death.

So began the Accession Crisis, in which all the dragons and their followers fought until only Pyrrha remained. On the eve of Pyrrha's total victory the last remaining Atargans stormed the Quaestine Palace (seat of Arcidaemonia, present day Braso-Aquitania). The hero Bedriatus struck down Pyrrha with a blade made from the bone of Atargatis.

The kingdom of Arcidaemonia split into warring factions which became the kingdoms of today. 

People still worship the dragons and a variety of lesser gods. Each kingdom has a general affinity to certain dragons based on the old Arcidaemonic states, but worship is a personal choice and often associated with ones profession.
